<h1>AI Is Coming</h1>
<p>This is undoubtedly the biggest piece of news of 2023, and you have, undoubtedly, already heard enough of it. But despite that, I felt compelled to write my thoughts on this.</p>
<p>I thought about writing this post after watching a YouTuber that I used to watch named KiloLoco, who discussed in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYv5vr6HMC0">YouTube video</a> (among other sad things) that
he&#8217;s thinking about going &#8220;all in&#8221; on AI, considering how much its already a big part of his
life. Indeed, AI is a big part of all of our lives, and more so for software developers who are seeing with their
very eyes the tools they created replace them.</p>
<p>I, along many other developers, fear for the future of our own careers. Software is a fast moving field. Some
things change, some things don&#8217;t. We are often always trying to find the next in demand thing, so we can
prepare for it. It&#8217;s an awful thing, but it&#8217;s sometimes necessary. And so naturally I&#8217;ve also
been thinking about what my future will look like as AI continues to progress.</p>
<p>More and more though, I&#8217;m convinced that the emersion of these proficient AI tools has made it
<em>especially</em> important for one to understand the basics: learning how to solve problems.</p>
