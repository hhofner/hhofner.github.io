# AI Is Coming

This is undoubtedly the biggest piece of news of 2023, and you have, undoubtedly, already heard enough of it. But despite that, I felt compelled to write my thoughts on this.

I thought about writing this post after watching a YouTuber that I used to watch named KiloLoco, who discussed in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYv5vr6HMC0">YouTube video</a> (among other sad things) that
he&#8217;s thinking about going &#8220;all in&#8221; on AI, considering how much its already a big part of his
life. Indeed, AI is a big part of all of our lives, and more so for software developers who are seeing with their
very eyes the tools they created replace them.

I, along many other developers, fear for the future of our own careers. Software is a fast moving field. Some
things change, some things don&#8217;t. We are often always trying to find the next in demand thing, so we can
prepare for it. It&#8217;s an awful thing, but it&#8217;s sometimes necessary. And so naturally I&#8217;ve also
been thinking about what my future will look like as AI continues to progress.

More and more though, I&#8217;m convinced that the emersion of these proficient AI tools has made it
<em>especially</em> important for one to understand the basics: learning how to solve problems.
