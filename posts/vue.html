	<h2>Some Thoughts On Vue (and its ecosystem)</h2>
	<p>
	  I've started working primarily with Vue.js at the start of this year. Before that, I had only worked with
	  React, and actually React was my introduction to web development (a scary thing to say in today's web dev world).
	  But since starting to work with Vue, I've also spent a lot of time writing vanilla JavaScript in my free time.
	  It's
	  important to do that, because I don't think that Vue & React have abstracted well enough to the point where you
	  don't
	  need to think about JavaScript. You're often still writing JavaScript, so I don't really think that abstracting
	  away the
	  quirks of vanilla JavaScript was a goal anyways.
