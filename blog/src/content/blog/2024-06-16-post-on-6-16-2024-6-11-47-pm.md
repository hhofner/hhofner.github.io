Showerish thought. The US kind of encourages (too much) to do all that's needed to make ends meet. Maybe that's why people are so eager to brake the law. And conversely, that's why so many people go to jail. Well I know jails are a very different problem and there are potentially other socioeconomic issues that are explain larger incarceration rates, but I can't help but think USA's go get it attitude doesn't help it at all.
