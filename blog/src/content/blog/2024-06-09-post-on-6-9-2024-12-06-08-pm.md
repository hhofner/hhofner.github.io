I am watching [Ryan's (Remix Guy) talk on React Server Component at Big Sky Dev Con](https://www.youtube.com/live/1g5ruM-16_Y?si=LKdg3jJvfSr4BwpD&t=9145). As always, very cool demo. I'm so weary though of these demos, though. It's not super intuitive for me to use RSC. If it was easy and I could do cool things like Ryan, then I'd love to try it, but in practice, it never really works that way. Skill issue, I suppose?
