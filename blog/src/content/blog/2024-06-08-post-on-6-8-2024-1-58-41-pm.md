For the record doctors are not special. They are not angels sent from the heavens. Many doctors have done malpractice. How many people have died under the guidance of doctors. Doctors are normal people that have just taken the time to study about medical topics. They are important for society. They are not special. Sometimes I feel that the impression around doctors is overblown again. They are very important just as garbageman are important. I don't entirely mean to equate doctors to garbagemen, but sometimes I think they should humble themselves.
