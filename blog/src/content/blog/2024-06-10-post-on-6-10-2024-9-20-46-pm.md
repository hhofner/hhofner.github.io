I've been taking kickboxing lessons for about a year now and it's really fun. I'm also do it because my wife is also enjoying it and slowly as I get better on it I get a bit more competitive and then I started to ask the question should I enter a tournament or a competition, but while going 10 one with someone is arguably the most fun part about kickboxing. I'm just not keen at all getting injured in anyway it's really fun to go against someone, but I just keep thinking about how getting repeatedly punched in the face or forehead raises the chances of getting a concussion, potentially cripples me, in terms of cognitive thinking not to mention the legs there's a high chance of getting injured there and this is even more relevant considering I had a pretty big injury not too long ago parentheses I broke my meniscus and had to get surgery for it.)
