After thinking a bit about why I'm trying to "invest time in Elixir", I understand why. It's because I believe the tools (and the language) developed in Elixir boast a complete package. Phoenix itself is a great example, you have everything and opinionated, unlike in the "JavaScript land", you have many choices for ways to organize your backend. Elixir also is showing great promise for AI, which is not something we can say for JavaScript. Lastly, I think I like functional programming far more than object oriented programming. I think these are all good reasons.
