Insane how OP the London System opening is for white. I'm wondering at what level do I start to hit players that know how to play against it with black. Currently I climbed up to 1400 in 3+2 blitz, I hope I can reach 1500. I have met a few 1400 that pose interesting challenges (knowing to play against the London effectively), but overall a lot of players get "rekt". I must study it more, it is way too much fun.
