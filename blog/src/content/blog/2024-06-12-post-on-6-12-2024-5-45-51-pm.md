Things that make me happy:

1. Passion for the game. *THE* Game. It's a fever all around the world. I love when stupid men get together and curse in unison. Cheer in unison. 
2. The view of a high mountain after a tough hike. Nothing feels better than that burn on your thighs and then getting to see a view that makes you feel like you're on top of the world.
3. Riding my bike on a sunny day, listening to music, sunglasses on. Riding to nowhere in particular, just riding, listening, basking in the sun. 

I think I need to go outside more.
