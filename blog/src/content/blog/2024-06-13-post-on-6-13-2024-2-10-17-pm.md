Zed editor is becoming really good. The aesthetics are okay, but it's maybe the best modern editor (to me) that looks to be as key-driven as possible. This may be partly because a lot of the developers on the team were/are vim users. Also, the team is wicked "cracked" as they say. They are updating the editor on a weekly basis (maybe more?) with impactful features. Literally it gets way better week by week. I guess I need to start using it more again.
