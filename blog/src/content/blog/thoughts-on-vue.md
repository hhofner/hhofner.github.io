I've started working primarily with Vue.js at the start of this year. Before that, I had only worked with React, and actually React was my introduction to web development (a scary thing to say in today's web dev world). But since starting to work with Vue, I've also spent a lot of time writing vanilla JavaScript in my free time. It's important to do that, because I don't think that Vue & React have abstracted well enough to the point where you don't need to think about JavaScript. You're often still writing JavaScript, so I don't really think that abstracting away the quirks of vanilla JavaScript was a goal anyways.
