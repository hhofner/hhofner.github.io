Today, I saw a [React Server Components tweet that talked about a "colossal security breach"](https://x.com/kossnocorp/status/1797472154683879566). I took a few minutes to try and understand what the issue was exactly, in the context of RSC. I didn't understand it at all. Now I'm a bit stressed, because I feel that I had only just gotten relatively good at React a few months ago.
