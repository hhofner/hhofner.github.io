I had a realization. I feel I am identity-less. 

I think deep down in my heart I am seeking something to belong to. I was never very patriotic. Living in Japan I sometimes feel a bit more patriotic. And I thought that yes, maybe this is it, I am finally American as it's meant to be. But I don't really want to go back. I don't really want to stay here either. There's no good place for me to go. I feel like there's no home for me, anymore.

Of course, home is where family is, but that's only about a few kilometers at most.
