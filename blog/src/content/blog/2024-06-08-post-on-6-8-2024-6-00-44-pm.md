I want to give up React. I feel like I have wasted so much time with it. It's a frontend library but somehow I get caught up in the weeds and what I really want to do is learn how to build apps from start to finish. That includes the backend and React does not include the backend. 

It gets even more ridiculous with RSC. I'm not looking forward to learning more just so I can generate a frontend that would have sufficed. 

This shouldn't stop me from learning about backend stuff, but I do feel it's a lot. Idk.
