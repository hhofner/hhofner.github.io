Coffee is a double-edged sword. Currently I am sitting here, high on caffeine, looking at WWDC and Twitter, and particularly all the cool and creative things people are building on there. 

But in the back of my mind is this dread of work. I need to do things that aren't particularly interesting or very creative. 

Need to fix this.
