I miss US at times , but, 

I can't imagine going for so long without some of the things I've taken for granted here in Japan. 

- First is Ryokans and onsens. They are so incredible. Great way to relieve stress, relax, help the local economy. And it feels great. 
- Actually reasonable toilets and showers. I love the separation between toilet and shower and I wouldn't have it any other way.
- trains trains trains trains trains trains 
- No religious people in my face
- Cheap skiing

I think there are other ones but these are really great.
