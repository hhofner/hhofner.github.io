I should go to the gym. 

I have worked with some designers that I kind of find a joy to work with. I like the way we do things. I wonder if I can take a shot and ask her if she'd be interested in ever doing some projects together. 

A designer that is product oriented, hands me the designs, is maybe something I can really get with.
