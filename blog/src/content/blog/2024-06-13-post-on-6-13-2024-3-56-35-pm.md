I am trying to overcome the nerd sniping that vim has become. 

I do not have time, nor the patience to handle the config in Neovim. 

I really do like the keyboard driven approach, but, I don't know how much it adds. It's more hobby than anything. 

But I'm not sure. I hate this. Because sometimes I can't let go. 

I don't know why I've been thinking of letting go. It's just that I am too interested in other editors. I'm here, I am there. I suck at everything. 

Why can't I be happy with anything.
