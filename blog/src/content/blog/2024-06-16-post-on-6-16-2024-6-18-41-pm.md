I think what I want to do is build my own, one or few person company.

I don't know if I could ever handle the stress of a full startup. It feels as if recently people create a startup without any thought of the product. People's eyes are only on the IPO. Of course you need to build a good product to get paying users, but often times it never plays out like that. It's because they don't really care about a good product, they care about paying customers (for an IPO). Take a look at Slack, Discord, Spotify...idk they are all slob in my opinion. And because paying customers is priority (yes it should be for a business...), they spend more money on marketing than development (don't quote me on this). 

I just mean perhaps I would love to make a company that values the quality of their product just as much as the satisfaction of their customers.
