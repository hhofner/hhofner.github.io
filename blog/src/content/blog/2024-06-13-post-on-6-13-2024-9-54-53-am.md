People advertise Discord servers like crazy. I have joined already a good handful of them and I can keep up with exactly 1 of them, of which the posts are relatively minimal. The rest are impossible. Not to mention how most technical discords are pretty close
to "slob". A handful of people show up, ask obscure niche questions and occasionally one or two smart guys answer most of these questions, there's hardly any discourse. 

Honestly quite frustrating.
