In general I just feel a lack of respect. I don't know why. It might really not be like that, that it's all in my head. 

But at times I find myself receiving advice from everyone...it somehow gets at me. Like I can't decide myself. Like I am not competent enough to figure it out, to do the "right and most reasonable" thing. It's not an individual, it's just the atmosphere around me. 

I have this urge to just run away, go somewhere, work my ass off and succeed in someway. To prove to people, to gain respect. Somehow.
