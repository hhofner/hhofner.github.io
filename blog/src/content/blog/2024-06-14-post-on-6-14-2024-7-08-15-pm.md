[Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) is a cool editor. It's not super pretty, but it's pretty enough. At least I think it looks better than VSCode. 

It's cool, the developers in my eyes are like superheroes. They are publishing a new version of Zed like almost every 5 days, and with a lot of these releases there's a lot of non-trivial things on there. They are flying. It sounds like a dream to me. 

It makes me a bit sad though, too. A bunch of rockstars get together and build something amazing. I don't feel like I can do that (yet). I mean it's not really something I particularly aspire to, but the notion sounds very cool. 

Another thing is that while I try to use Zed every now and then I feel that it's a bit wasted on me. Zed is the best collaborative editor out there, and I often wish I had the prowess to attract other skilled developers to work together with me.
