I watched a video about how having to actively use your brain to try and remember things (languages, streets, tasks, etc) was good for some particular brain development. A lot of it these days has been offloaded to phones so some studies show reduced development (I forgot what area and what it was called). I wonder if people who continue to learn and practice foreign languages will have better development in that area and if it makes a significant difference. Another reason for me to try and slog through countless Kanjis.
