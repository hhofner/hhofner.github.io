I'm a few minutes from having my bi-yearly checkup at the hospital for my meniscus/knee. It became bi-yearly from last year December, the doctor seemingly declaring that "I'm good", and so since then I've done some "dubious" things to my knee, such as some wicked skiing in the alps. But even during this time I felt good.

Only about ~2 weeks ago have I started feeling a bit weird around my meniscus. It doesn't hurt, nor is it swollen (I think). I don't necessarily feel weak either...but I do at times. Typically after some warmup I feel more stable. But overall, I just feel like my muscles around my knee are weak despite going to the gym for them. I guess maybe I am not going enough? I am not sure.
