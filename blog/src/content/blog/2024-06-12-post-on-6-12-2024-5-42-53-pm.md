It's days like these that really make me miss good ol' America. I really miss the environment around me. The people who always put a lot of trust in you, who encourage you to take risks, who are not scared of things. 

Sometimes I really need that friend who is like "that's a pretty steep drop...fuck it let's do it". 

Or the friend who, at a party the night before at 11pm tells me "wanna cycle 45km tomorrow morning?". 

I miss those days. I hate to reminisce, but I like it. Well anyways to kind of tie it all together, I definitely miss this "go-get-it-all" type of mentality. I feel there's too much cautiousness in my life. I don't want to be a dog with a tail between my legs. 

I want to be a charging moose.
