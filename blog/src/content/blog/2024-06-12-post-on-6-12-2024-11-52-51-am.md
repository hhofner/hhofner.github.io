I'm writing this to remind myself of how much I hate meetings and I hate emails. Just leave me alone.

Although I'm just not sure what the best solution to this communication stuff is . I do maybe think it would be best if we all took things a bit slower road a bit longer but more concise documents.

Honestly, some people think that when you get together with other people, you can collaborate better you think more but sometimes I think when I'm in a meeting with someone whether it's in person or not, I stop thinking unless I feel entirely comfortable with that person, but even then I still don't get those juices flowing. It's only when I'm sitting down in my own zone .
