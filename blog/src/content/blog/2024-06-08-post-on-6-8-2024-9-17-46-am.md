A lot of people can justify purchasing fancy out expensive tools to make their work environment better or make them productive. Not me though. I don't want to purchase anything that keeps me more inside. But I lie a bit. I've been thinking recently what would be a good expense for me, and funnily, I think something like running shoes makes sense. Anything that makes me go outside will make work better in the long run.
